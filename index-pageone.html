<h1>Welcome To My Website</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p><img src="C:\Users\admin.plaster\Desktop\Intro to IT\Re-Do/Picture of Me.jpg" alt="This is me" style="float:right;width:250px;height:500px">Hi, my name is Grace Field. Although, as there are many “Grace Field’s” in this world – seriously, I looked it up on Facebook and stopped counting after 50 “Grace Field’s”- at RMIT I’m identified by my student number, s3915295.</p>
<p>If you ever need to contact me my student email is as follows:s3915295@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
<p>I am the oldest of eight children, so it was quite interesting to see how that translated in my results of the personality tests that you will soon see.</p>
<p>I’m mostly of a European descent (which part of Europe totally beats me), however the second most interesting thing about me – after having seven younger siblings of course – is that I’m one-quarter Indonesian. My grandfather, or Opa, came to Australia from Indonesia where he met my grandmother, or Oma.</p>
<p>I, unfortunately, can only speak English, but I hope to learn Indonesian as it will open up communication to my great aunties, uncles and cousins that live in Indonesia.</p>
<p>I managed to finish my year 12 VCE Certificate, and after a year doing a Bachelor of Secondary Teaching (Major in History, Minor in Math) I dropped out and began a Traineeship in Business.<br>Currently I have a Certificate III in Business and I work full time as an administrator and estimator for a plastering company.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of my free time dancing, singing, and pretending I am on a Broadway stage playing every single cast member! I spend a lot of time listening to a musicals and trying to sing the main vocals, back up vocals, harmonies, and instruments all at the same time!</p>
<p> I hope that gave you a bit of an insight into me! Follow the below links to find our more...</p>

<h1>Why am I interested in IT?</h1>
<p>As someone that had very little to no idea of what IT is, aside from watching the IT Crowd of course, I shocked myself by applying for an Introduction to IT course. As a keen learner, I’m always looking for the next thing that I can learn, whether that be in my personal of professional life. As I was browsing courses on Open Universities Australia, I happened upon this Intro to IT course and it sparked a little light in my brain.
What exactly is IT? How can I be so reliant on something I know so little about? Why does the whole business/home shut down when IT doesn’t perform properly?</p>
<p>I often watch with baffled admiration when our IT company comes into the office to fix our various issues with technology. I get lost as they open up Notepad and enter in coding that I never thought I would understand, I watched as they remoted into my computer and withing minutes, had fixed an issue I had spent the past hour trying to fix! 
I wanted to understand how the systems I was using on a day to day basis worked! How is it that an email can be sent to and from people across the city? How does our accounting software take the numbers I put in and somehow form a report or a graph outlining that very information?</p>
<p>As I read through the course description for Introduction to IT at RMIT, I began to see that perhaps partaking in this course can be a step in helping me understand what IT is, and how it has become such an integral part of day to day life. I could learn how to develop a website for the business I work for, I could learn to solve basic IT issues in the work place, I could potentially create software that automated some processes in my admin or estimating job that would allow time for other work. The possibilities feel endless!</p>

<h1>My Ideal IT Job</h1>
<p>It was quite interesting looking into the different types of IT jobs out there. It’s incredible the complexity of IT and the importance of the people that understand it and can use it to benefit themselves and others.</p>
<p>As I was researching some of the various types of jobs, the one that really stood out to me was a Computer Systems Analyst.</p>
<p>As someone with more of a business background, this job seemed like the perfect mix of both business and IT knowledge. Taking challenges that a business may be facing and then designing an IT system that could provide a solution to that issue is exciting! Not only do you get to be creative in your ideas, but you also get to work closely with the business (or customer) to create something that will help them!</p>
<p>There are a huge number of skills, qualifications and experience needed for this kind of job. The ability to have good communication with clients and team members is a beneficial skill to ensure operations run with ease. Having the knowledge of application development, understandings of various tools and technologies is impressive experience required for a role such as this.</p>
<p>This role would require a Bachelor in Information Technology at the very least.</p>
<p>My personal skills would be excellent for a job like this! I already work within my business to constantly work on changes required to make our operations smoother. I’m able to effectively communicate with co-workers and clients, and I enjoy working both within a team and independently.</p>
<p>I currently only have a Certificate III in Business, and I have very little experience in IT aside from this 12 week course I’m partaking in. In order to acquire the skills needed for this job, I would complete Bachelor in IT. This would allow for me to obtain the knowledge I need for this job and help me get experience to do this. Once I am able to start working in the IT world, I will have to start small and low in rank in order to build up my knowledge and experience.</p>

<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
<p>I enjoyed reading the results of these tests. I'm very curious how answering some questions can create such an in depth analysis of my personality!</p>
<p>As I completed each of these personality tests, I noticed I seemed to be getting results that seemed pretty consistent with each other. My results showed that I was someone who looked out for other people and ensured that they were happy and comfortable, often putting their needs ahead of my own</p>
<p>These results, more or less, showed me what I already new. As the oldest child, I took it as my responsibity to make sure my younger siblings were happy and safe. I believe that this has been something I've carried throughout my life to the people around me.</p>
<p>The links to each test result and my own analysis are below! I hope you have as much fun reading them as I did!</p>

<h1>Myers-Briggs Test</h1>
<p>According to this test, I am an ISFJ-T.</p>
<p>Reading the results of this test was quite interesting. I consider this to be a relatively accurate depiction of my personality. As the oldest of eight kids, I was always their defender, and I always made sure that they were ok. I agree with the results, in that I’m naturally social but I’m actually an introvert, and that I tend to remember details about people rather than facts and figures.</p>
<p>I believe this shows I would be the “mum” of the team, always checking in on people making sure they are ok and handling the work-load. I would also be meticulous and a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to the final product.</p>
<p>When it comes to choosing team members, I will need to ensure that I choose people that are willing to put in and do the work with me. According to this test (and personal experience) I’m a bit of a pushover, and have a hard time saying no to a bigger workload. I will need to ensure that my team members are perfectionists like I am, and willing to do their share of the work.</p>

<h1>The Big Five Personality Test</h1>
<p>The results of this test didn’t shock me a great deal. My highest percentage was 75% (Agreeableness). This describes my tendency to put other people’s needs ahead of my own and to cooperate rather than compete with others.</p>
<p>This goes hand in hand with my Myers-Briggs results. I’m more willing to make sure other people are ok rather than start a conflict. This can work well within a team to ensure peace is maintained; however, it may mean that I struggle to put forward my own opinion as I would prefer everyone to be happy.</p>
<p>The results of this test shows me that I may need to work with people who are also agreeable and who I can work with and be open with, without fear of argument or judgement. I should also ensure that I do learn to say my part when I need to, especially if it is for the benefit of the team.</p>

<h1>Enneagram Test</h1>
<p>My results came back as Type 2 “The Giver”. According to these results, I am someone who seeks to unconditionally love and support the people around me. I do believe there is a consistent pattern between the three tests I have taken. Between being an ISFJ-T in the Myers-Briggs test, and having Agreeableness as my highest percentage in the Big Five test, and now being “The Giver” in this test, I believe this shows that I care more about the people around me and making sure that they are happy and comfortable.</p>
<p>Based off these results, in a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, I would most likely be the healer! Likewise, in a team I would be the one to emotionally support my team mates, I would make sure they are coping and handling the workload.</p>
<p>As I’ve stated before, I need to be careful of this when working within a team, I know that I can be pretty easy to walk over because I tend to focus on being empathetic and trying to understand other people’s point of views. I would like to carry this trait when I work within a team, but also make sure that I don’t forget my own opinions and ideas.</p>

<h1>Project Idea</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>What if there was a way you could keep track of your spending with minimal effort? My project idea is a budgeting app for lazy people. An app where you only need to spend 5-10 minutes setting up where you want your money to go, and the app does the rest.</p>
<p>I’ve tried many budgeting apps, and my biggest issue was just setting it up and then forgetting about it. I want this app to send out notifications, or text messages to allow the user to keep track of their spending without having to actually go into the app.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>How many people have a budget and actually stick to it? According to ME Bank’s Household Financial Comfort Report in 2017, around half of Australian’s have no cash left over by the end of every month! Can you imagine that kind of stress? Maybe you’re living out that kind of stress right now?</p> 
<p>I want this app to be designed for people who have very little time in their lives to organise their finances, or just don’t know how to budget, or are even just too lazy to make a budget! I want this app to be a way for the user to set up their budget and never have to look at it again.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This app will be a free mobile app, available for all types of phones. After the user links their bank accounts to the app, the app will be able to automatically track the users spending and create monthly graphs outlining their spending and where it is all going.</p>
<p>But what will set this apart from the many other budgeting apps? It will send out a notification when you spend money from an allocated budget. The notification will outline how much you have left in the budget for the week/ fortnight/ month, thus allowing the user to make a mental note and watch their spending for that specific budget.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through this step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user downloads the app onto their mobile phone and links their bank account.</li>
<li>The user then allocates their weekly/ fortnightly/ monthly income to separate budgets e.g groceries, petrol, food, shopping etc.</li>
<li>The user goes about their week, and as they spend money from the allocated budgets, they will be sent a notification. If, for example, the user allocated $50 in their food budget for the week, and they spend $30 at a restaurant, the app will send a notification along the lines of “You have spent $30 from your “Food” budget. You have $20 remaining till the end of the week”.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the notifications are the biggest part of the app, there are other features that it will have.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the app will have to be linked to the user’s bank account in order to track their spending and the type of spending they are doing. If the user is interested, they can use the app to look at where they are spending their money each week and adjust their budget accordingly. Taking this data, the app can create a monthly graph outlining in a simple, user friendly way, their spending of the past month.</p>
<p>Another feature of this app is setting goals. Money is not just about spending. In fact, there is a lot that we can do with our money if we only put a bit of effort and research. One of the things I find lacking in my own personal budget, is a goal!</p>
<p>This app will allow the user to enter a goal and assist them in reaching it within a specified timeframe. For example, if my goal were to save $5,000 by the end of the year. I would need to save around $185 per week for the rest of this year. The app could send a notification saying “Remember to put away savings for your Goal this week!”, or perhaps if I went over budget a certain week, it could adjust the weekly savings per week to continue to suit the end of year goal.</p>
<p>While I have a number of ideas for this app, I want the main focus to be on the notifications. Sending a notification to alert the user of how much money is left in an allocated budget, may at the very least, increase the user’s awareness of their spending.</p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>If I’m being 100% honest, I wouldn’t have the first idea of what sore of tools and technologies would be required to build an app such as this!</p>
<p>I believe one of the biggest hesitations people will have with an app like this, is security. After partaking in quite a bit of research, I learnt that a backend server is an important part of a mobile app. The backend of a system or an app includes the cybersecurity and data backups if the app. This is where the programming language will be stored, such as PHP or Python. Using software such as Firebase will provide tools to allow for tracking analytics and fixing crashes in the app.</p>

<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>There will be a considerable number of skills required to develop this app. Staring with the software that will need to be written. Unfortunately, as my experience is very minimal when it comes to writing software, it would take a bit more practice and training for me to learn how to do this. Fortunately, there are many places where I can learn the programming skills to start developing this app. I can even use GitHub to study what other developers have done and learn a some of the reasons for their decisions.</p>
<p>I will need to ensure the app is secure, especially as it will be dealing with bank accounts. This can be done through writing secure code and encrypting the data that is exchanged in the app.</p>
<p>Software will need to be written to analyse the type of purchases the user is making and determine what budget it will come out of e.g. groceries, petrol, food etc. There will also need to be software that takes this information and formats it in a graph for the user to see each month.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge for me, is knowing where to start with actually developing an app like this. I will need a lot of collaboration with others with much more experience with app development, programming, and app design.</p>
<p>If this project is successful, many people may be able to discover the comfort of financial security. My aim for this app, is to help people stop living paycheck to paycheck in an easy, low effort way. Through the use of notifications, it may reduce the need for the user to actually go into the app, thus allowing them to spend less time worrying about the budget, and more time enjoying a chance at financial security.</p>
