<h1>Learning Style Test</h1>
<p>My learning style was a majority Visual (55%). I’m already very aware of this, and I take every chance I can get to ensure that I am able to see something in order to learn about it. However, it did make me realise the way I teach is the same as the way I learn! We’ve recently had new employees at my work which I have been training, and I notice that I struggle to try and tell the new employees our process without drawing a picture or showing them the process.</p>
<p>Within a team, I may struggle if my teammates simply tell me what I need to do, or how to do something without showing me. It also means that if I try and explain something to my teammates, I might use drawings and pictures that they may not understand!</p>
<p>I believe it will be important for each of us to be aware of each other’s learning style in order to communicate with each other effectively and work together cohesively. I may even keep an eye out for other visual learners like myself!</p>
